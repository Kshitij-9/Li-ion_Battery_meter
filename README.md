# Li-ion_Battery_meter

# Components required - 
1.Arduino UNO
2.LCD 16x2
3.Jumper Wires
4.Bread board (if needed)


# This project is only ment for 1s batteries having peak voltage of 4.2V and nominal voltage of 3.7V-3.6V.

For the logic and formula I refered to the chart provided here : https://blog.ampow.com/lipo-voltage-chart/
I have provided this chart in this project in the form of excel sheet.

Circuit diagram is to be done as per the file provided.
For interfacing lcd with arduino LCD_PINS is provided for your reference.

# There are two programs gives,
# Batt_serial_test - This program can be used to view battery percentage on serial monitor(LCD is not required)
# Battery_meter - This programs can be used to view battery percentage on LCD
