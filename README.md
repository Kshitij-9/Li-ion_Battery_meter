# Li-ion_Battery_meter

This project is used for displaying battery percentage and voltage.

Components required - 

1.Arduino UNO

2.LCD 16x2

3.Jumper Wires

4.Bread board (if needed)


This project is only ment for 1s batteries having peak voltage of 4.2V and nominal voltage of 3.7V-3.6V.

For the logic and formula I refered to the chart provided here : https://blog.ampow.com/lipo-voltage-chart/
I have provided this chart in this project in the form of excel sheet.

For interfacing lcd with arduino LCD_PINS is provided for your reference.

There are two programs gives,
Batt_serial_test - This program can be used to view battery percentage on serial monitor(LCD is not required)
Battery_meter - This programs can be used to view battery percentage on LCD
